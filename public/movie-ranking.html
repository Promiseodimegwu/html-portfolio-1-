<h1>The Best Tv Shows According to Promise</h1>
<h2>My top series of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>how i met your mother</h3>
<p>All-time favourite. himym is to me what Star Wars is to Ted. The show really resonated with me in every possible level. </p>
<h3>Bojack Horseman</h3>
<p>Really good storyline and character arcs. The ending also was one to remember, it really did no wrong.</p>
<h3>The Last of Us</h3>
<p>Was already a huge fan of the game franchise (TLOU 2 more), the adaptation did right by its source. </p>
<h3>Loki</h3>
<p>Never seen a redemption so beautiful. He went from the God of Mischief to the God of Stories.</p>
